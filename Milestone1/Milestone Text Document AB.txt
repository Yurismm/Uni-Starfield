Milestone 1 <version 1> and <18/10/23>
--------------------------------

New Functionality
-----------------
I removed the initial way to clear the screen and replaced it with memset to clear it to 0 a little quicker.
Other than that I creates a star struct, added an if statement to prevent the stars from going outside of the window, and a continue within an if else to remove the checking of edistance
and resetting z to make it a bit more smooth looking and more efficent.

also implimented the equations that were on the slides to turn translate the 3d location of the stars into 2d


< A list of additional functionality in this release aimed at the user e.g. "Control of the player craft via the XBox controller".>

Code Additions
--------------

I added two keys that increment and deincrement the eye distance, s and w.

< A list of major additions e.g. classes, functions > 

There arent any functions though I did add a star structure and array


Tests
-----
During the practical we messed around with the star amount to see if the program would crash and in my own time I messed around with the values of Edistance and Z to make the movement look
a little better. We set the star amount from 300 to 30000, and we decreased the amount of z in the loop (deincrement) to 2 instead of 5 so it would make it more slow.


< A list of tests you have done to prove the milestone requirements have been met e.g. a stress test may be done where you try extreme values for things. e.g. render 1,000 sprites all at the same time.>

Notes
-----
Add screen clear to one colour back again.


<short notes on things left to do, issues and observations about possible future changes etc.>
